
On each trial, you will observe two bars presented on the screen. 
During a trial, the length of both bars will vary.

It will be your task to determine which bar was the LOWEST ON AVERAGE.

Use the keys A and L to select the left or right bar respectively.
    --> Use left hand for 'A' and right hand for 'L'!

After the small dot turns white, you have 3 seconds to register your response.
    
We will now start with a few practice trials where feedback will be given on each trial.
A green dot indicates a correct answer, a red dot indicates a wrong answer.

Please refrain from focusing on one bar only and try to fixate on 
the centre of the screen so that you can observe the left and the right bars equally well.

If your eyes did not focus on the fixation cross, feedback at the end of the trial
('Eyes moved') will notify you that the trial will be repeated at the end of
the experiment.
